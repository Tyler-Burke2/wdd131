      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The purpose of this site is to provide future employers with additional information about me beyond just what my resume presents. When applying for jobs on campus at BYU-Idaho, they often require a link to a linkedin OR a personal site. The creation of this site provides me a more personal webpage for employers to look at.</p>
      <!-- change this -->

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>This website is geared towards employers for any position which I may apply to in the future.</p>
      <!-- change this -->

      <h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
      <p>The main page of the site will be a general "About me" page in regards to necessary information for employers. It will be dynamic by including a timeline of milestones from my life that only appear as the user scrolls as well as a button at the bottom to generate random fun facts about myself. The child page of the site will be focused on my resume. It will be dynamic by including a dropdown menu which will allow a filter to show additional information beyond just what the resume presents.</p>

Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->

        This site will contain screenshots or images of the projects that I have completed and would like employers to see. If possible, I would like an expandable window that would be able to run the code in the screenshots or a way of interacting with the code similar to how chatgpt creates code.
